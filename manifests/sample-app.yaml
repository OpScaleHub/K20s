# --- 2. ResourceOptimizerProfile Examples ---
# Choose ONE of the following profiles to apply.

# Option A: "Recommend" Policy
# This profile will analyze the Nginx deployment and add a recommendation
# to the status field, but it will NOT perform any actions.
# This is the safest option to start with.
apiVersion: optimizer.k20s.opscale.ir/v1
kind: ResourceOptimizerProfile

  name: my-nginx-recommend

      app: my-nginx
  optimizationPolicy: Recommend
  cpuThresholds:

# Option B: "Scale" Policy
# This profile will automatically scale the number of replicas for the
# Nginx deployment up or down to keep CPU usage within the target range.
# apiVersion: optimizer.k20s.opscale.ir/v1
# kind: ResourceOptimizerProfile
# metadata:
#   name: my-nginx-scale

#     min: 20
#     max: 60
#   cooldownPeriod: "2m" # Wait 2 minutes between scaling actions
---
# Option C: "Resize" Policy
# This profile will automatically change the CPU requests of the Nginx
# pods to keep usage within the target range. It includes safety rails.

#   cooldownPeriod: "5m"
#   minCPU: "50m"   # Safety rail: never set CPU request below 50m
#   maxCPU: "500m"  # Safety rail: never set CPU request above 500m
